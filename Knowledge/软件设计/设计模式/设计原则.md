# 设计原则

找出程序中需要变化之处,把它们独立出来,不要和那些不需要变化的代码混在一起
Identify the aspects of your application that vary and separate them from what stays the same

针对接口编程, 而不是针对实现编程
Program to an interface, not an implementation

多用组合, 少用继承
Favor composition over inheritance

为了交互对象之间的松耦合设计而努力
Strive for loosely coupled designs between objects that interact

类应该对拓展开放, 对修改关闭
Classes should be open for extension, but closed for modification

最少知识原则
Principle of Least Knowledge

Don't call me, I will call you
